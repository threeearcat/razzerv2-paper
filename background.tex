\section{Background}
\label{s:background}

%While concurrency has been a cornerstone of performance benefits in
%the multicore era, it leaves a risk of malfunction, \ie, concurrency
%bug, caused by insufficient thought of concurrent events.
%
In this section, we introduce prior fuzzing approaches to discover 1)
bugs in the kernel~(\autoref{ss:kernelfuzzing}), and 2) concurrency
bugs~(\autoref{ss:concurrencyfuzzing}).



% \subsection{Concurrency Bug}
% \label{ss:concurrencybugs}
% A concurrency bug is a bug that manifests depending on the timing of
% concurrent events (\eg, memory accesses) that access shared data.
% %
% More specifically, two instructions \textit{conflict} if \textbf{1)}
% they access the same memory location, \textbf{2)} at least one of them
% is a store operation, and \textbf{3)} they are executed concurrently.
% %
% Then, a concurrency bug manifests depending on interleaving order of a
% set of conflicting instructions.

% A concurrency bug is


% \dr{TODO: define conflicting accesses somewhere}

% A concurrency bug can be classified into two categories according to
% how it adversely affects a program.

% \PP{Data race.}
% %
% Although the concept of data race is well known, its formal definition
% depends on a programming language~\cite{C-standard-n2310,
%   java-standard} or a program in development~\cite{lkmm}. In this
% paper, we employ the definition from Linux Kernel Memory Model
% (LKMM)~\cite{lkmm}. According to LKMM, a data race occurs when there
% are two memory accesses such that 1) they access the same location, 2)
% at least one of them is a store, 3) at least one of them is not
% annotated with special operations such as \texttt{WRITE_ONCE()}, or
% \texttt{smp_load_acquire()}, 4) they occur on different CPUs (or in
% different threads on the same CPU), and 5) they execute concurrently.
% %
% Informally, a data race indicates un-annotated concurrent accesses to
% a shared memory location.

% Data races are problematic because they may confuse a compiler.  LKMM
% allows a compiler to assume that there will be no data race during the
% runtime. Based on the assumption, a compiler has its rights to
% arbitrarily transform plain accesses (\ie, accesses not annotated with
% above operations), making the results unpredictable if there is a data
% race during the runtime.
% %
% Therefore, LKMM defines the outcome of the program as undefined
% behavior if a data race occurs.
% %
% Also, to prevent such undefined behaviors, LKMM requires developers to
% annotate accesses if they possibly run
% concurrently~\cite{data-race-fix1, data-race-fix2, data-race-fix3}.
% % %
% % On the other hand, data races may or may not cause a real-world issue
% % such as memory corruption. Many data races fixes~\cite{data-race-fix1,
% %   data-race-fix2, data-race-fix3} annotate memory accessing
% % instructions with above operations, which actually does not affect the
% % compiled binary.


% \PP{Race condition.}
% %
% Race condition is another type of concurrency bug. While a race
% condition broadly indicates that an outcome differs depending on the
% timing of concurrent events, we restrict the definition to indicate
% the correctness of the outcome differs according to the timing of
% concurrent events.
% %
% Specifically, if developers do not take consider of all possible
% interleavings, a program may execute an erroneous interleaving which
% leads the program into an unintended state.
% %
% Immediately or after a certain amount of time, the unintended state
% causes erroneous behaviors of the program such as memory corruption,
% deadlock, and assertion violation.

% % \dr{TODO: what more?}
% % In order to fix the errorneous interelaving, developers often utilize
% % synchronization primitives such as a lock, or switch the order of
% % instructions in a program~\cite{learningfrommistakes}.

% %
% \PP{Differences between data race and race condition}
% %
% \dr{TODO: rewrite to enphasize that finding race condition is
%   important and combine this into the race condition paragraph}
% %
% Although both race condition and data race are a bug caused by
% concurrenct events, there are a few differences.
% %
% First, a data race is regards to a single pair of conflicting accesses
% while a race condition is about an interleaving.
% %
% Therefore, methods to detect them are also different.  While data race
% detectors~\cite{tsan, krace, prorace, crsampler, txrace} monitor
% whether two conflicting plain accesses are executed concurrently, race
% conditions can be observed only through an erroneous behavior caused
% by a specific interleaving.
% %
% Second, whereas a data race occurs if such conflicting accesses exists
% no matter it causes an erroneous behavior or not, a race condition is
% told by an abnormal outcome of a program.
% %
% % In the security perspective, a data race requires further
% % investigation to determine whether it is harmful or
% % not~\cite{portend, replayanalysis}, the effect of a race condition
% % is exmained by erroneous behaviors such as general protection fault,
% % assertion violations, sanitizers~\cite{asan, kasan} and
% % lockdep~\cite{lockdep} reports.

% %     focuses on the striped region. \dr{I don't think we need this.}}
% %   \label{fig:venndiagram}
% % \end{figure}
% %
% Lastly, they are not a subset or a superset of one another. Although
% there are race conditions that occur with data races, neither one is
% the sufficient nor necessary condition for the other. Therefore, we
% would argue that finding data races and finding race condditions are
% complementary with each other.


% \PP{Scope of this paper}
% %
% This paper focuses on finding race conditions instead of data races.

% \dr{TODO: why? want to say finding race condition is more important,
%   and existing approaches to find data races are limited}

% \dr{TODO: need to say the importance of observing erroneous outcomes}

\subsection{Kernel Fuzzing}
\label{ss:kernelfuzzing}


\subsection{Concurrency Fuzzing}
\label{ss:concurrencyfuzzing}


% During fuzzing, a fuzzer determines that interleavings of given
% concurrent jobs are tested enough if a concurrency coverage is
% saturated while a customized scheduler is introduced to tailor the
% non-deterministic behavior.


In spite of enormous efforts, finding concurrency bugs is still a
daunting task.
%
It is mainly due to two challenges such that 1) concurrency bugs are
inherently caused non-deterministically, and 2) the number of possible
interleavings grows exponentially to the number of memory access
operations.

Recently, several studies~\cite{razzer, krace, snowboard, muzz} have
been proposed to improve fuzzing techniques specifically in exposing
concurrency bugs.
%
These studies generally adopt two strategies, namely thread scheduling
control to tame the non-determinism, and coverage metric in the
concurrency dimension (shortly, concurrency coverage metric) to
capture interesting interleavings among all possible interleavings.

% \PP{Coverage-guided fuzzing}
% %
% Throughout decades, a fuzzing has shown its ability to find bugs in
% various software layers including the userprogram space~\cite{qsym,
%   driller, crfuzz, r2z2, cafl, fuzzorigin} and the kernel
% space~\cite{fuzzusb, syzkaller, hfl, cabfuzz, razzer, krace, janus,
%   hydra, healer}.
% %
% A primary task of fuzzing is to synthesize and mutate various inputs
% of a target program.
% %
% When running the inputs, a fuzzer monitors a program's behavior, and
% observes malfunctions with a help of various developer
% tools~\cite{asan, kasan, meds}.

% A coverage-guided fuzzer adopts a coverage metric to abstract
% program's interesting behaviors.
% %
% During fuzzing, a fuzzer accumulates all experienced coverage as the
% abstraction of tested behaviors of a program.
% %
% When a new input is given, a fuzzer compares coverage of the input
% with the accumulated coverage to determine whether the input exposes a
% new interesting behavior. If it does, a fuzzer keeps and mutates the
% input to generate another input that potentially exhibits unknown
% coverage.

% \dr{TODO: Do we need to tell about coverage-directed fuzzers?}


\PP{Concurrency coverage metric.}
%
To the best of our knowledge, Krace~\cite{krace} is the first work
that asserts the necessity of a coverage metric in the concurrency
dimension.
%
While many coverage metrics are proposed with their own pros and
cons~\cite{wang2019sensitive}, they only track the sequential aspect
of a program (\eg, branch coverage tracks whether a branch is taken or
not) without paying attention to communication between threads.
%
Krace states that even after sequential coverage is saturated, there
could be more interesting behaviors caused by thread interleavings,
and that if there are unexplored thread interleavings in an input, a
fuzzer should keep paying attention to the input.

To capture unique behaviors in the concurrency dimension, Krace
proposes a coverage metric called alias coverage.
%
Alias coverage tracks inter-thread data flow between a pair of
instructions. In other words, alias coverage tracks
\texttt{$I_S \rightarrow I_L$} if a load instruction \texttt{$I_L$}
reads a value written by a store instruction \texttt{$I_S$} and they
are executed in different threads.
%
% For example, if a fuzzer wants to test an interleaving that , it can
% instruct a scheduler to enfore such requirement on the two
% instructions.
%
\dr{TODO: MUZZ, and others?}
%
Although Razzer~\cite{razzer} and Snowboard~\cite{snowboard} adopt a
hint-directed scheduler, they do not make use of a concurrency
coverage metric. Therefore they do not distinguish whether two inputs
exhibit different behaviors. Instead, they concentrate on less
frequent inter-thread data flow based on an idea that those
inter-thread data flow is less likely tested and more likely causes an
abnormal behavior.

\PP{Thread scheduling control.}
%
\dr{TODO: customized scheduler --> thread scheduling control}
%
Instead of relying on the uncontrollable kernel scheduler, concurrency
fuzzing generally consists of a customized scheduler to increase the
probability of bugs being exposed.
%
Depending on how a customized scheduler schedules instructions, it is
largely categorized into randomized scheduler and scheduling
hint-directed scheduler (shortly, hint-directed scheduler).

A randomized scheduler~\cite{ski, pctalgorithm, krace, sparsernr} is
designed to randomly schedule intstructions in a disciplined
manner. It tries to keep only one thread to execute while the thread
runs until a certain number of instructions are executed or a certain
amount of time has elapsed.
%
A fuzzer and the scheduler share a small number of parameters used for
the scheduler to pseudo-randomly determine the number of instructions
or the amount of time to execute.
%
In this way, interleavings are diversified across fuzzing runs while a
fuzzer can tailor the non-determinism caused by scheduling.

On the other side, a hint-directed scheduler~\cite{razzer, snowboard}
enfoces a specific requirement of interleaving called a scheduling
hint.
%
A scheduling hint is generally in the form of an interleaving pattern
that possibly causes a concurrency bug. For example, a scheduling hint
may consists of execution order indicating a single-variable order
violation; \textit{``thread A executes a store operation writing into
  $X$ before thread B executes a load operation reading from $X$''}.
%
During fuzzing, a fuzzer keeps generating different scheduling hints,
and enforces an interleaving that contains a scheduling hint to
observe the interleaving causes an erroneous behavior.
