\begin{abstract}

Fuzzing kernel concurrency bugs is challenging. Identifying kernel
concurrency bugs, as opposed to non-concurrency bugs, necessitates an
analysis of possible interleavings between two or more threads. 
Because the interleaving search space is vast, it is practically 
impossible to investigate all conceivable interleavings.  
To explore the vast search space, 
most previous approaches perform simple heuristic searches without 
having coverage for thread interleaving or with an insufficient form 
of coverage.  As a result, they either conduct wasteful searches with
redundant executions or overlook concurrent bugs that their coverage 
cannot address.

To overcome such limitations, we propose \sys, a fuzzing framework for
kernel concurrency bugs. When exploring the search space, \sys
decomposes entire thread interleavings to a set of segments each of
which has the small number of instructions, and utilizes individual
segments as interleaving coverage, called \intcov.  At each search
step, \sys mutates interleavings in each segment to construct new
thread interleavings that has not yet been explored (i.e., not
recorded in the \intcov). With \sys, we discover new 21 concurrency
bugs in Linux kernels and demonstrate the efficiency by showing that
\sys can identify known bugs up to \yj{xx} times quickly than the
state-of-the-art approaches, Snowboard and KRACE.
