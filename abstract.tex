Fuzzing kernel concurrency bugs is challenging. Unlike non-concurrency
bugs, identifying kernel concurrency bugs requires investigation of 
possible interleavings between two or more threads. 
The interleaving search space is huge, so it is nearly impossible 
to explore all possible interleavings. To explore the vast search space, 
most previous approaches perform simple heuristic searches without 
having coverage for thread interleaving or with insufficient coverage 
metric. H
