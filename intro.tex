\dr{TODO: term consistency: interleaving order <-> interleaved instruction}

Multi-core era, many techniques are integrated in kernel to improve performance. 

The consequence of kernel concurrency bugs is disastrous. They crash
the entire system, breaking availability or causing data loss. 
Furthermore, attackers 
exploit a concurrency bugs to mount a privilege escalation attack.
A recent study~\cite{exprace} demonstrates that an user-level attacker 
reliably exploits non-deterministic concurrency bugs without performing
brute-force attacks.

Identifying kernel concurrency bugs is much more difficult than 
finding non-concurrency bugs. 
In contrast to non-concurrency bugs which can be identified by 
sequential testing of a single thread execution,
kernel concurrency bugs are typically caused by the concurrent execution 
of two or more threads.
Kernel concurrency bugs manifest only by a specific sequence of
instruction interleavings between threads. The interleavings happens 
rarely because it happens only when a specific timing condition is met.
To discover concurrency bugs, it is not practical to explore all
the possible interleavings because the number of instruction
executed by a system call in Linux is huge.
%Due to such difficulty, traditional fuzzers..

To increase efficiency of concurrency bug fuzzing, several approaches
have been proposed. SKI, Razzer, Snowboard, Krace.\yj{what else?}
\dr{as far as I know, there are conzzer and muzz}
% Snowboard uses edge-coverage...

\dr{I am thinking about not mentioning Snowboard as a fuzzer. In fact,
  it is *NOT* a concurrency fuzzer. The paper says Snowboard is a
  framework to generate concurrenct tests.}

\dr{Anyway, if we consider Snowboard as a fuzzer, Snowboard does not
  adopt an interleaving coverage metric, so it cannot distinguish two
  interleavings, and it relies on *heuristics* to determine which
  interleavings should be explored}

To overcome the limitation of previous approaches, this paper proposes
\sys, a framework for efficiently discovering kernel concurrency bugs. 

Key insights: 
i) new coverage metric reflecting the nature of concurrency bugs.
ii) systematic, efficient search strategy guided by the coverage metric.




We describe our contributions in three folds:

\begin{itemize}
\item interleaving segment coverage
\item speculative interleaving exploration based on explored interleaving
\item We have found \totalbugs race conditions.
\end{itemize}
