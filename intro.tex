\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

\dr{Our approach is good to 1) address the nature of race conditions,
  and 2)diversify interleavings}

\dr{Copied from the learning from mistakes paper:}

The complexity of this design is only polynomial to the number of
dynamic memory accesses, which is a huge reduction from the
exponential-sized all-interleaving testing scheme.  Furthermore, the
bug exposing capability of this design is almost as good as exploring
all interleavings. It would miss only few bugs in our examination.

We describe our contributions in three folds:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \item We have found \totalbugs race conditions.
\end{itemize}
