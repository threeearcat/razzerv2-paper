\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate \sys in
various aspects.
%
Specifically, we 1) demonstrate the practicality of
\sys by providing newly found concurrency
bugs~(\autoref{ss:realworldbugs}),
%
2) provide comprehensive performance characteristics of \sys (\eg,
throughput and overheads)~(\autoref{ss:characteristics}), and
%
3) compare \sys against prior concurrency fuzzing
techniques~(\autoref{ss:comparison}).

\subsection{Finding Real-world Concurrency Bugs}
\label{ss:realworldbugs}

In order to demonstrate the practicality of \sys, we

  \input{table/newbugs.tex}

  \caption{List of concurrency bugs newly discovered by \sys. The
    \texttt{Recurrent} column denotes that a crash was previously
    addressed but reoccurs even after its patch is applied.}
  \label{table:newbugs}
\end{table*}

\PP{Experimental setup.}
%
To discover new concurrency bugs, we evaluate \sys on a two-socket
machine equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz (40MT
cache) and 512\GB of RAM.
%
This machine provides 32 total cores and 64 total threads, and runs
Ubuntu Server 20.04.4 LTS on Linux 5.4.143 as a host operating system.
%
To build a guest kernel, we use a kernel configuration used by
\texttt{Syzkaller}~\cite{syzkaller} so that \texttt{Syzkaller} and
\sys search for bugs in similar kernel modules/subsystems.
%
We run \sys for approximately two monts on latest versions of the
Linux kernel ranging from 5.19-rc2 to 6.0-rc7.


\PP{Newly found concurrency bugs.}
%
During our evaluation, \sys discovers 83 unique crash titles including
ones that \texttt{Syzkaller} also finds. Among them, \totalbugs are
newly identified as harmful concurrency bugs as summarized in
\autoref{table:newbugs}.
%
This table shows that \sys is able to find bugs across the entire
kernel from specific device drivers~(\eg, \texttt{\#1}, and
\texttt{\#6}) to various network subsystems (\eg, \texttt{\#2},
\texttt{\#16}, and \texttt{\#17}); Since \sys is not tailored to
specific subsystems, \sys entails the \textit{generality} and is
applicable to various subsystems.

\sys is also able to find not only less-harmful bugs such as warnings
(\eg, \texttt{\#12}) but also critical bugs such as memory corruptions
(\eg, \texttt{\#2}, \texttt{\#6}, and \texttt{\#14}).
%
It is worth noting that in our evaluation, unlike previous
works~\cite{snowboard, krace} that rely on data race
detectors~\cite{kcsan, tsan}, all concurrency bugs are found by
observable and harmful incidents such as kernel panics or KASAN
reports.
%
We believe data race detectors and our approach are complementary in
finding concurrency bugs. We discuss this in the discussion
section(~\autoref{s:discussion}).

Interestingly, we find that many of bugs was previously found and
addressed, but they reoccur possibly because of their incomplete
fixes~\cite{learningfrommistakes}.
%
In \autoref{table:newbugs}, three that are marked in the
\texttt{Recurrent} column are cases that reoccur long time (\eg,
hundreds days) after their fixes are applied.
%
These cases emphasize the importance of effective testing even after
bugs are exposed and fixed accordingly.






\subsection{Fuzzing Characteristics}
\label{ss:characteristics}

As the coverage growth is the important performance metric, we compare
\sys with prior works.




\subsection{Comparison with prior approaches}
\label{ss:comparison}

\begin{table}[t]
  \input{table/knownbugs.tex}
  \centering
  \caption{Known CVEs caused by kernel concurrency bugs.}
  \label{table:knownbugs}
\end{table}

We compare \sys against various prior approaches to provide a .

\PP{Bug selection}
%
\autoref{table:knownbugs} represents concurrency bugs we use for the
comparison study.
%
For fair comparisons, among all kernel concurrency bugs that are used
to evaluate previous studies on kernel concurrency bugs~\cite{exprace,
  razzer, snowboard, krace}, we select ones that their exploits are
publicly available such that we can make use of them for our evaluation.
%
In particular, the exploit of
\texttt{69e16d01d1de}~\cite{snowboardbug} is not publicly available,
we successfully reproduce the concurrency bug from the description in
the Snowboard~\cite{snowboard} paper.
%
Also, even though KRace~\cite{krace} studies kernel concurrency bugs
(\ie, data races), we do not have access to concurrency bugs that the
authors use to evaluate KRace.
