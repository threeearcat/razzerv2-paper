\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate \sys in
various aspects. Specifically, we 1) demonstrate the practicality of
\sys by providing newly found concurrency
bugs~(\autoref{ss:realworldbugs}), 2) comprehensive \sys's performance
characteristics (\eg, throughput and
overheads)~(\autoref{ss:characteristics}), and comparison studies
against state-of-the-art concurrency fuzzing~(\autoref{ss:comparison}).

\subsection{Finding Real-world Concurrency Bugs}
\label{ss:realworldbugs}

\begin{table*}[t]
  \input{table/newbugs.tex}

  \caption{List of concurrency bugs newly discovered by \sys.}
  \label{table:newbugs}
\end{table*}

In order to demonstrate the practicality of \sys, we ran \sys on
latest versions of the Linux kernel ranging from \XXX{} to \XXX{}.  We
ran \sys for approximately two months.

\PP{Experimental setup.}
%
All of our evaluations were performed on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
E5-4655 v4 @ 2.50GHz (30MB cache) with 512GB of RAM.


\PP{Newly found concurrency bugs.}
%
\autoref{table:newbugs} summarizes crashes found by \sys. During our
experiment, \totalbugs crashes are newly found.

\subsection{Fuzzing Characteristics}
\label{ss:characteristics}

As the coverage growth is the important performance metric, we compare
\sys with prior works.




\subsection{Comparison with prior approaches}
\label{ss:comparison}

\begin{table}[t]
  \input{table/knownbugs.tex}
  \centering
  \caption{Known CVEs caused by kernel concurrency bugs.}
  \label{table:knownbugs}
\end{table}

We compare \sys against various prior approaches to provide a .

\PP{Bug selection}
%
\autoref{table:knownbugs} represents concurrency bugs we use for the
comparison study.
%
For fair comparisons, among all kernel concurrency bugs that are used
to evaluate previous studies on kernel concurrency bugs~\cite{exprace,
  razzer, snowboard, krace}, we select ones that their exploits are
publicly available such that we can make use of them for our evaluation.
%
In particular, the exploit of
\texttt{69e16d01d1de}~\cite{snowboardbug} is not publicly available,
we successfully reproduce the concurrency bug from the description in
the Snowboard~\cite{snowboard} paper.
%
Also, even though KRace~\cite{krace} studies kernel concurrency bugs
(\ie, data races), we do not have access to concurrency bugs that the
authors use to evaluate KRace.
