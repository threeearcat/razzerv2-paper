\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate \sys in
various aspects. Specifically, we 1) demonstrate the practicality of
\sys by providing newly found concurrency
bugs~(\autoref{ss:realworldbugs}), 2) comprehensive \sys's performance
characteristics (\eg, throughput and
overheads)~(\autoref{ss:characteristics}), and comparison studies
against state-of-the-art concurrency fuzzing~(\autoref{ss:comparison}).

\subsection{Finding Real-world Concurrency Bugs}

  \caption{List of concurrency bugs newly discovered by \sys.}
  \label{table:newbugs}
\end{table}

In order to demonstrate the practicality of \sys, we ran \sys on
latest versions of the Linux kernel ranging from \XXX{} to \XXX{}.  We
ran \sys for approximately two months.

\PP{Experimental setup.}
%
All of our evaluations were performed on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
E5-4655 v4 @ 2.50GHz (30MB cache) with 512GB of RAM.


\PP{Newly found concurrency bugs.}
%
\autoref{table:newbugs} summarizes crashes found by \sys. During our
experiment, \totalbugs crashes are newly found.

\subsection{Fuzzing Characteristics}
\label{ss:characteristics}

As the coverage growth is the important performance metric, we compare
\sys with prior works.




\subsection{Comparison with prior approaches}

In this subsection, we compare \sys against various prior approaches
to provide a .

\PP{Bug selection}

\autoref{table:knownbugs} represents concurrency bugs we use for the
comparison study.

For fair comparisons, we select concurrency bugs according to follow
criteria: 1)
