\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate \sys in
various aspects.
%
Specifically, we 1) demonstrate the practicality of \sys by providing
newly found concurrency bugs in the Linux
kernel~(\autoref{ss:realworldbugs}),
%
2) provide comprehensive performance characteristics of \sys (\eg,
throughput and overheads)~(\autoref{ss:characteristics}) and,
%
3) compare \sys against prior concurrency fuzzing
techniques~(\autoref{ss:comparison}).

\subsection{Finding Real-world Concurrency Bugs}
\label{ss:realworldbugs}

In order to demonstrate the practicality of \sys, we run \sys to
discover concurrency bugs in the latest Linux kernel.

\begin{table*}[t]
  \input{table/newbugs.tex}
  \centering
  \caption{List of concurrency bugs newly discovered by \sys. The
    \texttt{Recurrent} column denotes that a crash was previously
    addressed but reoccurs even after its patch is applied.}
  \label{table:newbugs}
\end{table*}

\PP{Experimental setup.}
%
To discover new concurrency bugs, we evaluate \sys on a two-socket
machine equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz (40MT
cache) and 512\GB of RAM.
%
This machine provides 32 total cores and 64 total threads, and runs
Ubuntu Server 20.04.4 LTS on Linux 5.4.143 as a host operating system.
%
To build a guest kernel, we use a kernel configuration used by
\texttt{Syzkaller}~\cite{syzkaller} so that \texttt{Syzkaller} and
\sys search for bugs in similar kernel modules/subsystems.
%
We run intermittently \sys for approximately two monts on latest
versions of the Linux kernel ranging from 5.19-rc2 to 6.0-rc7.


\PP{Newly found concurrency bugs.}
%
During our evaluation, \sys discovers 83 unique crash titles including
ones that \texttt{Syzkaller} also finds. Among them, \totalbugs are
newly identified as harmful concurrency bugs as summarized in
\autoref{table:newbugs}.
%
This table shows that \sys is able to find bugs across the entire
kernel from specific device drivers~(\eg, \texttt{\#1}, and
\texttt{\#6}) to various network subsystems (\eg, \texttt{\#2},
\texttt{\#16}, and \texttt{\#17}); Since \sys is not tailored to
specific subsystems, \sys entails the \textit{generality} and is
applicable to various subsystems.

\sys is also able to find not only less-harmful bugs such as warnings
(\eg, \texttt{\#12}) but also critical bugs such as memory corruptions
(\eg, \texttt{\#2}, \texttt{\#6}, and \texttt{\#14}).
%
It is worth noting that in our evaluation, unlike previous
works~\cite{snowboard, krace} that rely on data race
detectors~\cite{kcsan, tsan}, all concurrency bugs are found by
observable and harmful incidents such as kernel panics or KASAN
reports.
%
\dr{}
We believe data race detectors and our approach are complementary in
finding concurrency bugs. We discuss this in the discussion
section~(\autoref{s:discussion}).

Interestingly, we find that many of bugs was previously found and
addressed, but they reoccur possibly because of their incomplete
fixes~\cite{learningfrommistakes}.
%
In \autoref{table:newbugs}, three that are marked in the
\texttt{Recurrent} column are cases that concurrency bugs reoccur even
after their fixes are applied.
%
These cases emphasize the importance of effective testing even after
bugs are exposed and fixed accordingly.






\subsection{Performance characteristics of \sys}
\label{ss:characteristics}

In this subsection, we analyze various performance characteristics of
\sys to comprehend how the \sys's approach affects the fuzzing
process.

\PP{Coverage growth.}
%
\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{fig/coverage_graph-crop.pdf}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:eval:coverage}
\end{figure}
%
Since coverage metrics are the paramount performance metric of
fuzzing, we first measure the coverage growth \dr{}


\PP{Fuzzing throughput.}
%
\begin{table}[t]
  \small
  \centering
  \input{table/throughput}
  \caption{Fuzzing throughput (\# of exec/s) of \sys and
    \texttt{Syzkaller}. \texttt{Syzkaller-memtrace} indicates
    throughput of \texttt{Syzkaller} with memory access tracing
    enabled.}
  \label{table:throughput}
\end{table}
%
All \sys's mechanisms entail the trade-off; they provide benefits in
finding concurrency bugs with a cost of additional overheads and
throughput degradation.
%
To comprehend the trade-off, we measure the fuzzing throughput of \sys
and compare it with the \texttt{Syzkaller}'s throughput.
%
Since fuzzing throughput is highly affected by initial seeds, we
measure throughput with an empty set of seed. And because both
\texttt{Syzkaller} and \sys restart VMs after an hour of fuzzing, we
run them for an hour and measure throughput in order to eliminate
noises caused by, for example, VM rebooting or kernel crashes.

\autoref{table:throughput} shows the result. As expected, \sys shows
the lower throughput than \texttt{Syzkaller}. In particular, the
\sys's throughput is about 54\% of the \texttt{Syzkaller}'s
throughput.
%
To further understand why the \sys's throughput is degraded, we
additionally measure throughput of \texttt{Syzkaller} with memory
access tracing enabled (but not making use of it).
%
As shown in the \texttt{Syzkaller-memtrace} column in
\autoref{table:throughput}, it shows the throughput similar to that of
\sys; the \texttt{Syzkaller-memtrace}'s throughput is 4.1\% higher
than the throughput of \sys.

\dr{This is similar argument with KRace:}
These results indicate that the throughput of \sys is mainly degraded
by the heavy instrumentation to trace memory accesses.
%
However, as KRace~\cite{krace} states, it can be understandable as a
trade-off between throughput and seed quality.
%
In the fuzzer's perspective, while tracking memory accesses has
negative impacts on throughput, it provides a higher chance for a
fuzzer to execute more interesting inputs (\ie, interesting thread
interleaving) and not to waste computing resources.




\PP{Per-input execution time}
%
\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \input{table/elapsedtime.tex}
  \caption{\dr{rewrite:} Elapsed time (ms) for executing one input.}
  \label{table:elapsedtime}
\end{table}
%
\dr{Rewrite}
%
To closely examine \sys's overheads, we measure the elapsed time for
an iteration of a fuzzing loop, and break down the elapsed time into
time taken by computation (\ie, incurred by generating a schedule and
checking new coverage) and execution of an input.
%
It is worth noting that executing an input entails two overheads for
controling thread interleaving and tracing memory accesses. To
identify how much each overhead occupies, we disable XXX and YYY, and
again measure elapsed times.
%
For each measurement, we run 10 thousands times and take an average.

\autoref{table:elapsedtime} shows the result. When executing the
input, the computational overhead is approximately 9\% of the total
elapsed time. In contrast, executing an input takes the longest time
out of the total elapsed time.
\dr{}



\subsection{Comparison with prior approaches}
\label{ss:comparison}

\begin{table}[t]
  \input{table/knownbugs.tex}
  \centering
  \caption{Known concurrency bugs that are studied by previous
    studies, Razzer~\cite{razzer}, ExpRace~\cite{exprace}, or
    Snowboard~\cite{snowboard}.}
  \label{table:knownbugs}
\end{table}

We compare \sys against various prior approaches to provide a .

\PP{Bug selection}
%
\autoref{table:knownbugs} represents concurrency bugs we use for the
comparison study.
%
For fair comparisons, we select kernel concurrency bugs that are used
to evaluate previous studies on kernel concurrency bugs~\cite{exprace,
  razzer, snowboard, krace}. Specifically, among concurrency bugs used
in previous studies, we select ones that their exploits are publicly
available such that we can make use of them for our evaluation.
%
The exploit of \texttt{69e16d01d1de}~\cite{snowboardbug} is not
publicly available, we successfully reproduce the concurrency bug from
the description in the Snowboard~\cite{snowboard} paper.
%
Also, even though KRace~\cite{krace} studies kernel concurrency bugs
(\ie, data races), we do not have access to concurrency bugs that the
authors use to evaluate KRace.
