\section{Evaluation}
\label{s:eval}

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate \sys to
answer the following questions
\begin{itemize}
\item Is \sys able to find real-world concurrency
  bugs~(\autoref{ss:realworldbugs})
\item Is \sys able to capture concurrency coverage faster than
  previous approaches~(\autoref{ss:coveragegrowth})
\item Is \XXX{} suitable to capture interesting
  behaviors~(\autoref{ss:suitability}).
\end{itemize}

\PP{Experimental setup.}
%
All of our evaluations were performed on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU
E5-4655 v4 @ 2.50GHz (30MB cache) with 512GB of RAM.


\subsection{Finding Real-world Concurrency Bugs}
\label{ss:realworldbugs}

\end{table}

In order to prove the practicality of \sys, we ran \sys on latest
versions of the Linux kernel ranging from \XXX{} to \XXX{}.  We ran
\sys for approximately two months.

\autoref{table:newbugs} summarizes crashes found by \sys. During our
experiment, \totalbugs crashes are newly found.

\subsection{Coverage Growth in the Concurrency Dimension}
\label{ss:coveragegrowth}

\begin{table}[t]
  \input{table/knownbugs.tex}

\end{table}


As the coverage growth is the important performance metric, we compare
\sys with prior works.
