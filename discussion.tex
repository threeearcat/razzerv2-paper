\PP{Data race detectors}
%
Data races are a \textit{subset} of concurrency bugs, while this work
focuses on concurrency bugs including data races and non-data race
concurrency bugs.
%
In fact, data race detectors are orthogonal to \sys, thus, data race
detectors can be easily integrated into \sys to provide a stronger
concurrency bug detection capability.
%
For example, during our evaluation, \sys can easily trigger non-data
race concurrency bugs (\eg, CVE-2019-6974, \texttt{69e16d01d1de}) that
cannot be detected using a data race detector, while data race
detectors can detect non-memory corruption bugs such as performance
degradation. We provide more details in \autoref{s:appendix:datarace}.


\PP{Larger interleaving segment}
%
While we restrict the size of each interleaving segment to four, a
small fraction of concurrency bugs (\eg, 8 out of 105 from a survey
study~\cite{learningfrommistakes}) are triggered with interleaving
segments with size of larger than four.
%
Thus, interleaving segment coverage falls short in tracking offending
interleavings of this kind of concurrency bugs, while the speculative
interleaving exploration is still able to trigger them via recomposing
multiple interleaving segments.
%
Since this kind of bugs also may severely affect the security of the
kernel, we leave how to track their offending interleavings using
interleaving coverage as future work.
