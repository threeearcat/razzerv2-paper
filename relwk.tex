For decades, immense efforts have been made to effectively discover
concurrency bugs. In this section, We describe prior efforts in three
categories, data race detection, controlled concurrency testing, and
fuzzing.


\PP{Data race detection}


\PP{Controlled concurrency testing}

\PP{Fuzzing}
%
Since a kernel is a security basis of most systems, eliminating bugs
in a kernel is a paramount task to provide reliable
services. Therefore, many fuzzing approaches have been proposed to
find out bugs as the first step towards eliminating them.

Although we adopt Syzkaller as its sequential mutation, 

\PP{Concurrency fuzzing}
%
To the best of our knowledge, Razzer~\cite{razzer} is the first
attempt to improve a fuzzing technique in discovering concurrency
bugs.

The main idea of Razzer is to guide


After Razzer, Krace~\cite{krace} asserts the necessity of a coverage
metric in the concurrency dimension. Krace defines alias coverage
