For decades, immense efforts have been made to effectively find out
bugs in various softwares through fuzzing. We describe prior efforts
in two categories, kernel fuzzing and concurrency fuzzing.

\PP{Kernel fuzzing}
%
Since a kernel is a security basis of most systems, eliminating bugs
in a kernel is a paramount task to provide reliable
services. Therefore, many fuzzing approaches have been proposed to
find out bugs as the first step towards eliminating them.
