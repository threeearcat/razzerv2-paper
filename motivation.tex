In this section, we first describe how concurrency bugs manifest
depending on thread interleaving.
%
And then, we define design requirements to discover concurrency bugs
in the kernel.
%
Lastly, we summarize why existing approaches do not satisfy the design
requirements.



\PP{Manifestation of concurrency bugs}
%
A concurrency bug indicates a type of bugs that manifest depending on
the timing of concurrent events (\eg, memory accesses).
%
Specifically, if kernel developers do not take consider of all
possible instances of thread interleaving, the kernel may execute an
erroneous instance of thread interleaving.
%
Consequently, concurrency bugs such as memory corruption, memory leak,
or deadlock, may occur.

    binder driver.}
  \label{fig:cve-2019-6974}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:cve-2019-6974} describes how an erroneous instance of
thread interleaving causes a concurrency bug.
%
In this example, a NULL-dereference bug may manifest when two system
calls are executed concurrently: \texttt{mmap()} to map the device
driver into a user address space and \texttt{ioctl(TRANSACTION)} to
send an IPC message.


Assuming \texttt{alloc->vma} and \texttt{alloc->mm} are initially
\texttt{NULL}, the race condition manifests depending on the execution
order of four memory accesses, \texttt{A1} and \texttt{A2} in
thread~A, and \texttt{B1} and \texttt{B4} in thread~B.
%
During mapping the device driver into a user address space, thread~A
sets \texttt{alloc->vma} and \texttt{alloc->mm} to non-NULL pointers
at \texttt{A1} and \texttt{A2}.
%
However, since these store operations are not atomically executed,
thread~B may intervene in the middle of these two operations.
%
In that case, if \texttt{A1} is executed before \texttt{B1}, thread~B
does not return at \texttt{B3} because thread~B reads a non-NULL
pointer value through \texttt{alloc->vma}.
%
And then if \texttt{B4} is executed before \texttt{A2},
\texttt{alloc->mm} still remains \texttt{NULL} when thread~B
increments the reference counter of \texttt{alloc->mm} at \texttt{B4},
causing a NULL-dereference bug.



It is noteworthy that the manifestation of a concurrency bug is
\textit{a combined result of a few conditions on the execution order
  of instruction pairs that access shared data.}
%
In this example, since \texttt{A1} and \texttt{B1} access shared data
called \texttt{alloc->vma}, the execution order of these two accesses
may change the kernel's execution. Among the two possible execution
order of \texttt{A1} and \texttt{B1},
$\texttt{A1} \rightarrow \texttt{B1}$ is required for the
NULL-dereference to manifest.
%
Similary, the execution order of \texttt{A2} and \texttt{B4} also
affects the kernel's execution, and
$\texttt{B4} \rightarrow \texttt{A2}$ is necessary to cause the
concurrency bug.
%
In summary, among all possible conditions on the execution order of
these instructions, \textit{only}
$(\texttt{A1} \rightarrow \texttt{B1}) \wedge (\texttt{B4} \rightarrow
\texttt{A2})$ causes the NULL-dereference bug.


% In this example, we can confirm that the manifestation of the race
% condition follows the implications of previous studies; the race
% condition manifests if \textit{two} scheduling constraints on
% \textit{four} memory access operations (\ie,
% $(\texttt{A1} \rightarrow \texttt{B1}) \wedge (\texttt{B4} \rightarrow
% \texttt{A2})$) are conjunctively satisfied.


% One of the factors that makes it difficult to find concurrency bugs is
% that, they may be detected only when a program shows an abnormal
% behavior.
% %
% \autoref{subfig:racecondition} is the example of such concurrency bug.
% %
% In this example, the timing of accesses are not correctly
% contemplated. When instructions are executed in the order of
% \dr{TODO:}..., the program runs differently than the developer
% intention, causing a use-after-free bug.
% %
% However there are no plain accesses (\ie, all accesses are annotated),
% and therefore, there is no data race.
% %
% By the definition, data race detectors~\cite{tsan, kcsan, krace,
%   prorace, txrace, crsampler} are not applicable to detect this kind
% of race conditions.


% In worse cases, race conditions hardly manifest with the kernel
% scheduler. In detail, a race condition may manifest only when one
% thread stalls for a long time while another thread executes numerous
% instructions.
% %
% One could argue that those concurrency bugs are not a threat because
% it may take too long time, or even impossible to exploit.
% %
% However, a recent study, ExpRace~\cite{exprace}, reveals that an
% attacker can affect the kernel's scheduler using inter-processor
% interrupts (IPI), and exploit even such concurrency bugs.


\PP{Design requirements}
%
The main goal of this paper is to effectively find out concurrency
bugs through fuzzing.
%
Considering the numerous number of possible instances of thread
interleaving, we identify two design requirements to explore the
search space of thread interleaving as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A fuzzer needs a coverage metric in the concurrency dimension to
  determine if any interesting interleaving remains
\item 
\end{itemize}


In other words,


\subsection{Limitation of prior approaches}
\label{ss:existingapproaches}

Even though prior approaches achieved their own successes, none of
them satisfy the two design requirements.

In the perspective of fuzzing, a coverage metric is a paramount gear
to determine whether a given input is worthy of further mutation.
%
If a coverage metric does not represent whether an input has a
potential to trigger a race condition, a fuzzer may ignore inputs in
which there are unexplored interleavings, or waste the computing power
to valueless inputs.
%
In this regard, our primary question is whether existing coverage
metrics in the concurrency dimension are suitable to apprehend
interleavings potentially causing a race condition, for example,
$(\texttt{A1} \rightarrow \texttt{B1}) \wedge (\texttt{B4} \rightarrow
\texttt{A2})$ in \autoref{fig:cve-2019-6974}.



Unfortunately, we observe that none of existing approaches incorporate
a proper coverage metric for race conditions.
%
A few of existing approaches~\cite{snowboard, razzer} do not adopt a
coverage in the concurrency dimension at all. Therefore, they do not
make a decision as to whether a given input is worth further testing.
%
Other approaches~\cite{krace, muzz} adopt coverage metrics that are
not suitable for race conditions as they do not consider a combined
result of multiple pairs of conflicting accesses. As a consequence,
race conditions may not be exposed even after the coverages are
saturated.
%
% Consequently, existing approaches have difficulty in distinguishing a
% given input has a potential to cause an interesting behavior, \ie,
% a race condition.


\begin{figure}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{fig/alias-coverage.pdf}
  \caption{Three inputs that consist of two concurrent syscalls. For
    all inputs, thread~A executes the same \texttt{mmap()} syscall
    while thread~B handles different ioctl requests. For brevity, we
    describe only conflicting instructions.\dr{Change the name of two
      ioctls in input 1 and 2}}
  \label{fig:alias-coverage}
\end{figure}

\yj{This is the key paragraph to point out the limitation of previous approaches, but very vague. Make specific claims of why Kraces' alias coverage is insufficient by giving an example.}
%
In order to show why comprehending multiple pairs of conflicting
accesses is important, let us suppose we have three inputs that
consists of two concurrent syscalls as described in
\autoref{fig:alias-coverage}.
%
For all inputs, thread~A executes a \texttt{mmap()} syscall to map the
binder driver to a user address space while thread~B handles different
ioctl requests such that \texttt{ioctl(FREE_BUFFER)},
\texttt{ioctl(REPLY)}, and \texttt{ioctl(TRANSACTION)} for
\texttt{Input 1}, \texttt{Input 2}, and \texttt{Input 3} respectively.
%
It is worth noting that in \texttt{Input 1} and \texttt{Input 2},
there is only one pair of conflicting accesses; in \texttt{Input 1},
the two threads conflict on \texttt{alloc->vma}, and in \texttt{Input
  2}, the two threads conflict on \texttt{alloc->mm}.



\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig/alias-coverage-interleaving.pdf}
  \caption{Four interleavings of \texttt{Input 1} and \texttt{Input 2}
    in \autoref{fig:alias-coverage}. After executing these four
    interleavings, all possible execution orders of a single
    conflicting accesses are exhibited.\dr{Run 1 -> Interleaving 1?}}
  \label{fig:alias-coverage-interleaving}
\end{figure}

In this example, if we adopt a coverage metric that focuses on a
single pair of conflicting accesses (\eg, alias coverage), a fuzzer
may not recognize that \texttt{Input 3} may exhibit a different
behavior than \texttt{Input 1} and \texttt{Input 2}~(\ie, a
NULL-dereference bug).
%
\autoref{fig:alias-coverage-interleaving} shows four interleavings
that exhibits all execution order of a single pair of conflicting
accesses. If a fuzzer executes \texttt{Input 1} with interleavings in
\texttt{Run 1} and \texttt{Run 2}, a fuzzer observes execution orders
such as $\texttt{A1} \rightarrow \texttt{B1}$ (in \texttt{Run 1}) and
$\texttt{B1} \rightarrow \texttt{A1}$ (in \texttt{Run 2}).
%
Similary, if a fuzzer executes \texttt{Input 2} with interleavings in
\texttt{Run 3} and \texttt{Run 4}, it observes execution orders of
$\texttt{A2} \rightarrow \texttt{B4}$ (in \texttt{Run 3}) and
$\texttt{B4} \rightarrow \texttt{A2}$ (in \texttt{Run 4}).
%
After executing these four interleavings, \texttt{Input 3} does not
reveal a new execution order of a single conflicting
accesses. Therfore, as a Krace state, a fuzzer may de-prioritize
\texttt{Input 3}, and the race condition may not be found.

In summary, in order to determine whether an input shows interesting
behaviors or not, a fuzzer needs to comprehend \textit{a combined
  result of multiple pairs of conflicting accesses} as it is the
primary reason of race conditions.


\cut{
Approaches that adopt a randomized scheduler~\cite{krace, ski, muzz}
suffer from the inherent randomness.
%
When the randomness comes to concurrency bugs, this could become a
significant drawback.
%
Although interleavings are affected by a fuzzer, a fuzzer cannot fully
control how interleaving takes place. Thus, a fuzzer may need to
indiscriminately execute the same input until its coverage is
saturated.
%
Furthermore, it is almost impossible for randomized schedulers to
expose concurrency bugs requiring an extreme interleaving such that
\dr{TODO: explain:}non-inclusive race conditions~\cite{exprace} or ones that
require a very small race window.
%
In contrast, approaches with a hint-directed scheduler is able to
explore all interelavings including even ones that hardly occur if a
proper scheduling hint is given. Therfore, they are able to find out
such race conditions.
%
However, existing approaches~\cite{razzer, snowboard} are not suitable
of diversifying interleavings. \ie, they change very small part of
interleaving across runs.
%
Even with a single input, they require a large number of execution to
test the input enough.
